          elgallo1: Eli Neuman-Hammond- The Americanization of Shmuel
        </summary>
        <p>
          A family sings and listens together, trying to remember
          lullabies--lost, teetering on the edge of memory. An old man
          recollects moments in his life from before and after World War II. The
          wind ebbs and flows, shifting and eroding syllables. An artist plays
          with time in his studio.

          <i> The Americanization of Shmuel </i> is a historical sound work
          trying to make small bits of meaning from the debris that the angel of
          history leaves in its wake. It’s a polyphonic, multilingual map of
          songs, places, movements, and assimilation, made in eighteen sections.
          There are two parts which alternate and overlap. The first part is
          noise. It’s sometimes wind, sometimes an inverted floor, at times the
          tide, a valley, snow, sleep - and always a screen, which both masks
          and becomes a surface of projection. The other part is made of
          recorded fragments.

        In 1963, my grandparents Lily and Sam founded el Gallo de Oro on Calle
        Fortaleza in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Both were immigrants to the island,
        but for more than 50 years their jewelry store was a staple in the old
        city, a magical place where you could find warm conversation and
        precious, beautiful things from all over the world.<br />They closed
        shop in 2010, and fourteen years later I re-opened el Gallo as a
        publisher of audio and letters.<br />-Eli Neuman-Hammond
