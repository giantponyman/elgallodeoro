          2. But a storm is blowing from Paradise (19:45)
          <em>Ella Heron and Eli Neuman-Hammond</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          &ldquo;The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole
          what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing from Paradise; it has
          got caught in his wings with such violence that the angel can no
          longer close them. The storm irresistibly propels him into the future
          to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows
          skyward. This storm is what we call progress.&rdquo; -Walter Benjamin,
          1940

          <em>The Americanization of Shmuel </em>is a historical sound work
          trying to make small bits of meaning from the debris that the angel of
          history leaves in its wake. It&rsquo;s a polyphonic, multilingual map
          of songs, places, movements, and assimilation, made in eighteen
          sections There are recorded fragments. And then there is the wind, the
          noise, an inverted floor, at times the tide, a valley, snow,
          sleep&ndash;and always a screen, which both masks and becomes a
          surface of projection.

          In <em>But a storm is blowing from Paradise</em>, Ella Heron works
          with the structure and meaning of the first piece to make a
          scaffolding for improvised saxophone.

          Recorded by Eli Neuman-Hammond 2019-2025. Mastered by Sean McCann.

        In 1963, my grandparents Lily and Sam established el Gallo de Oro on
        Calle Fortaleza in San Juan, Puerto Rico. For more than fifty years
        their jewelry store was a staple of the old city, a magical place where
        you would always find warm conversation and precious, beautiful things
        from all over the world. In 2010 they closed shop, and in 2024 I
        re-opened el Gallo de Oro as a publisher of audio projects and print
        editions.
