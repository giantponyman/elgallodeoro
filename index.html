          1. The Americanization of Shmuel (20:54)
          <em> Eli Neuman-Hammond</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          2. But a storm is blowing from Paradise (19:45)
          <em>Ella Heron and Eli Neuman-Hammond</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>The Americanization of Shmuel</b> is a polyphonic, multilingual map
          of songs, places, movements, and assimilation. There are recorded
          fragments, flotsam and debris left in the angel of history‘s wake. And
          then there is the noise, an implacable wind, an inverted floor, at
          times the tide, a valley, snow, sleep–and always a screen, which both
          masks and becomes a surface of projection. The wind ebbs and flows,
          shifting and eroding syllables and dividing the piece into 18 parts –
          numerologically the Hebrew word חי or "life", made up of the letters
          Chet (ח) and Yud (י).
        </p>

        <p>
          There are three narratives that weave through the piece. The first to
          appear concerns an intergenerational family. They sing and listen
          together, trying to remember lullabies. Some of these songs have been
          reproduced through generations of singing, some of them are lost, or
          teetering on the edge of memory. They sing and speak a variety of
          languages – Italian, Spanish, Yiddish, English, Arabic, Hebrew.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the second narrative a piano melody undergoes transformations and
          permutations. The melody was originally written for the 1964 anti-war
          comedy “The Americanization of Emily,” and then arranged and
          popularized by Jazz pianist Bill Evans. These recordings are made in
          an artist’s studio, where you can hear the artist manipulating a
          computer that processes and “mis-remembers” the melody using a simple
          markov chain patch.
        </p>

        <p>
          The third narrative is about an old man, Sam or “Shmuel,” recollecting
          moments in his life from before and after World War II. He speaks
          English with an old voice and a thick accent. In 1944 he was deported
          from the Carpathian mountains to the concentration camp Auschwitz
          where his four siblings, parents, and grandparents were killed. Sam
          and his brother escaped in 1945, after which both were mistakenly
          taken by the Soviet army as prisoners of war and imprisoned for two
          months. They narrowly escaped exile to Siberia. From there he and his
          brother briefly returned to their village in the mountains, which was
          unrecognizable, and then smuggled themselves into mandatory Palestine
          via Britain’s Jewish Brigade, before eventually immigrating to
          Barranquilla, Colombia, then to Newark, New Jersey, and finally to San
          Juan, Puerto Rico, where he has lived most of his life in diaspora and
          where he raised his three daughters, one of which is the artist’s
          mother.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>But a storm is blowing from Paradise</b> is saxophonist Ella
          Heron’s melodic response to the embedded histories of the A side. It
          is a prayer to the Last Angel of History recorded in wind and metal.
        </p>

        <p>
          The theme common to both sides of the record is how private cultures
          of transmission resist nationalistic monopolies on space, narrative,
          and history.

        In 1963, my grandparents Lily and Sam established el Gallo de Oro on
        Calle Fortaleza in San Juan, Puerto Rico. For more than fifty years
        their jewelry store was a staple of the old city, a magical place where
        you would always find warm conversation and precious, beautiful things
        from all over the world. In 2010 they closed shop, and in 2024 I
        re-opened el Gallo de Oro as a publisher of audio projects and print
        editions.
