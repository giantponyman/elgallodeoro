  <details><summary>elgallo2: Eli Neuman-Hammond - "I recognize the mountains."
  </summary>
  <p>"I recognize the mountains." is on the one hand a version of the <i>sh'ma</i> and on the other hand an impressionistic portrait of two voices marked by the twentieth century. It queries the possibilities and limits of transmission, taking place within an envelope of possibility opened up through the passing of time, physical distance, and intergenerational encounter.

<details><summary> elgallo1: Eli Neuman-Hammond and Ella Heron- The Americanization of Shmuel
</summary>
<p>A family sings and listens together, trying to remember lullabies--lost, teetering on the edge of memory. An old man recollects moments in his life from before and after World War II. The wind ebbs and flows, shifting and eroding syllables. An artist plays with time in his studio. </p>
  <p> <i> The Americanization of Shmuel </i> is a historical sound work trying to make small bits of meaning from the debris that the angel of history leaves in its wake. It’s a polyphonic, multilingual map of songs, places, movements, and assimilation, made in eighteen sections. There are two parts which alternate and overlap. The first part is noise. It’s sometimes wind, sometimes an inverted floor, at times the tide, a valley, snow, sleep - and always a screen, which both masks and becomes a surface of projection. The other part is made of recorded fragments.
