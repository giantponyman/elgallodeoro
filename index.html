          A family sings and listens together, trying to remember
          lullabies--lost, teetering on the edge of memory. An old man
          recollects moments in his life from before and after World War II. The
          wind ebbs and flows, shifting and eroding syllables. An artist plays
          with time in his studio.

          <i> The Americanization of Shmuel </i> is a historical sound work
          trying to make small bits of meaning from the debris that the angel of
          history leaves in its wake. It’s a polyphonic, multilingual map of
          songs, places, movements, and assimilation, made in eighteen sections.
          There are two parts which alternate and overlap. The first part is
          noise. It’s sometimes wind, sometimes an inverted floor, at times the
          tide, a valley, snow, sleep - and always a screen, which both masks
          and becomes a surface of projection. The other part is made of
          recorded fragments.

        In 1963, my grandparents Lily and Sam established el Gallo de Oro on
        Calle Fortaleza in San Juan, Puerto Rico. For more than fifty years
        their jewelry store was a staple of the old city, a magical place where
        you would always find warm conversation and precious, beautiful things
        from all over the world. In 2010 they closed shop, and in 2024 I
        re-opened el Gallo de Oro as a publisher of audio projects and limited
        edition books.
